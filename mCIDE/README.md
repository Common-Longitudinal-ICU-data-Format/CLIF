# mCIDE: minimum Common ICU Data Elements for CLIF

The CLIF format and federated research approach aspires to adhere to the [2023 NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#after) and the [FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Resuable) data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

Common Data Element (CDEs) "are data elements (or variables) that are defined and used the same way across multiple studies, to standardize the way data is collected"

We have constructed a minimum set of Common ICU Data Elements (mCIDE) with following features:

1.  represents a precisely defined clinical entity
2.  limited set of permissible values

`*_category` variables are CIDEs. For more details, explore the [CLIF Website](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/mCIDE.html).
