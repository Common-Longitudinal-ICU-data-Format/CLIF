SAS,Score (Score range: 1-7),,Sedation/Agitation
sat_delivery_pass_fail,"Indicates the outcome of the SAT trial (pass or fail), based on flowsheet data charted by the care team. This variable reflects the result of the trial, not whether it was attempted or initiated.",,SAT Delivery Pass/Fail

sat_screen_performed,Check for whether the screen was conducted (Boolean:  0/1) ,,SAT Screen
sat_sedative_infusion,"Checks whether the patient is receiving sedative infusions, such as for seizure control or alcohol withdrawal. Sedation for these conditions must be absent for the SAT to proceed.",,Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT)
